	\section{Introduction}
		By analysing weather data we can obtain a lot of information about our climate, changes to it and fluctuations from year to year. 
		This project will use ROOT from Cern to analyse data from a number of weather stations positioned in different parts of Sweden. Using 
		this data we pick a date and measure the temperature for that specific date over a few years in order to see the fluctuations over the years. 
		Next we looked at the temperature of all days over a year. We also search for the warmest and coldest days of every year. 
		Finally we looked at the highest temperature of a year for all recorded datasets.
