\section{Conclusion}

By analyzing data, a great deal of hidden information can be obtained. This could be 
seen in this project, where a huge amount of temperatures were analyzed. Once the 
first challenge of the project - and perhaps the most important one - was passed and the 
data could be read, the actual analysis could begin. \\

\noindent First two histograms were made, with 
the datasets from Luleå and Lund, of March 3rd. From these histograms, the mean 
temperatures of that day in the two cities were found to be $-8.37^\circ$ for Luleå and 
$0.44^\circ$ for Lund. Thereafter, the warmest and coldest days in Lund 
were searched for. A histogram was made and afterwards fitted with a gaussian. The mean
for the warmest day was found to be 196 and for the coldest it was 24, meaning that the 
warmest day in Lund is most likely to occur in June, while the coldest is most likely 
to occur in January. The average temperature of each, also in Lund, was then calculated.
The plotted results showd that the temperature starts low in the beginning of the year, 
increases towards the middle of the year and then decreases again towards the end of it. 
In the final part of this project, the highest temperature of the year for all cities, 
was obtained. In the results all cities were plotted in the same (messy) graph. From this
graph it can be seen that the highest temperatures climb and fall together. \\ 


\noindent Although the results obtained in this project are quite expected and not very 
surprising, it is 

it is interesting to see what kind of information can be extracted with an 
analysis. 


...and what the many possibilites are 

Having the right analysis tools can help us obatine results ..
